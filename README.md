## Usage

TODO: Fill out this segment.

## Prerequisites

  * Ubuntu 20.04 or later (likely works on older too)
  * `zabbix-agent` installed.
  * Python 3.7 or later (can run on at least 3.6 with minor modifications)

## Installation

The default configuration should work under the assumption the prerequisites are
met.

```
$: make
$: sudo make install
```

## Caveats

  * As of this commit it is very much an experimental project.
    Use at your own risk!
